# Gate Opener
## About
A python web application for opening and closing a gate with AI detection of... whatever you want to trigger it. Robot lawnmowers, ride on lawnmowers people, animals, cars and so on.

You can choose to use the existing categories provided by the model, but also provided is a really simple training interface that allows you to get good results by training it on real things in your yard, so how you trigger it is entirely up to you!

There are two empty functions waiting for you to fill with your own code to trigger relays or whatever to open the gate.

I should say I have not used this yet as the gate I want to use it on is not in great shape, and I have not connected it to any kind of gate opening hardware yet.

I have currently only tested it on an AGX Orin, so I don't really know how it will perform on your platform.
